# 🐍 Snake Game

A classic Snake Game built using **HTML5 Canvas**, **JavaScript**, and **CSS**. Control the snake, eat the food, and grow as long as possible while avoiding collisions with the walls and your own body!

## 🚀 Features

- **Snake movement:** Move the snake in all four directions using arrow keys.

- **Dynamic Difficulty:** Option to change snake speed based on difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).
- **Game over detection:** Ends the game when the snake hits the walls or itself.
  
## 📚 Where did I get the idea for this game?

I recently attended the **Flair Haven Web Development Workshop** at **Maulana Azad National Institute of Technology (MANIT), Bhopal**, led by an instructor from **Coding Thinker**. During the workshop, I learned how to work with the HTML5 Canvas, which inspired me to create this Snake Game.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake:
  - `↑` Up
  - `↓` Down
  - `←` Left
  - `→` Right
- Eat the apple to grow and increase your score.
- The game ends if the snake hits the walls or its own body.
